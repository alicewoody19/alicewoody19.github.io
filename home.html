<h1>Alice Woodward's Online CV</h1>

     <p class="position"> 
        Hello, My Name is Alice Woodward, I am a nineteen year old student from Alsager in Cheshire. Welcome to my website, I have created this website, to showcase games in which I have made, including think of a number. There is also the opportunity to contact me, if there were any questions or if you wanted to contact me personally. On the website is the pages My Education and Contact Me. </p>

<H2>Information about myself:</H2>
 
<p> 
    <p class="position">
    I studied at Alsager High School from 2011 to 2015 doing my GCSEs, I then furthered my education by doing my A-Levels at Alsager Sixth Form. I left in 2017 after two years, to study at Staffordshire University where I am currently studying Business Information Systems in Organisations.
    </p>

<p>
    <p class="position">
    I have also done work experience at Poole Alcock Solicitors, where I helped implement a new IT system into the Alsager Branch, this involved helping the solicitors to use the new system. As well as this I have also had work experience at my old Primary School, where I helped with the lessons and helped the teacher maintain the class.</p>

<div id="achievements">
<p>
    <p class="position">
    Throughout my years in Education, I have been very lucky to win some awards that show all the hard work I put into my work and lessons.
</p>
<p>
    <p class="position">
    One of the awards which I have won is an award from my GCSE's. I won the Food Technology Award, which showed the hard work I put into making different types of food and my coursework. I was very proud to win an award in something I feel so passionate about.
</p>
<p>
    <p class="position">
    One of my greatest achievements was passing my GCSE's and my A-Levels, I felt it showed that all my hard work had paid off. I have always doubted my abilities and have lacked confidence, so getting the marks I did, really made me believe in myself and proved that if you put your heart into something, it will pay off.             
</p>
<p>
    <p class="position">
    Another Award was the Head Teachers Award at the end of my A-Levels. This award was given to me because of my progression throughout the years at school and  the grades which I achieved throughout my Alsager High School Years.<br><br/>        
    For me this was one of my greatest achievements, to end my amazing years at High School and Sixth Form, by being given an award for all my hard work.
</p>

<p> 
    <p class="position">
    One of my latest achievements, was  getting into University to do a subject which I feel passionately about. To be able to further my knowledge in the wonderful subject is a proud moment, because not a lot of women do ICT and especially in the year of the women, I want to prove women are equally as able to do the same things as men do in this industry.
